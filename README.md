Data for the work entitled 'Transgenerational Effects of Early-Life Stress on Anxiety in Zebrafish (Danio rerio)'

This repository contains data for the effects of early-life adversity in zebrafish across 3 generations. 

Time spent in the dark zone, distance travelled and time spent in the top were used for the Fig.1 and contains data for F0, F1 and F2. F0 data was previously published as described in our full work. 

Pavlovian fear conditioning index, FMP Y-maze (total turns, alternations and repetitions) as well as shoal data (distance between fish and shoal area)  contains information for F1 and F2. For those behaviors, no significant difference was found in our previous work when looking at F0 and was not included in this set of data.
